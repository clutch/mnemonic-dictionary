# Mnemonic Dictionary
#

A review app for the Mnemonic Dictionary.

This application alows a user to create word sets of at most 5 words, each word containing:

1. Spelling
2. Pronunciation
3. Definition
4. Key
5. Link

Once created the application will timestamp the set and make it available for review **immediately**, and after **1 day**, **3 days**, **7 days**, and every **3 weeks**. As the sets are reviewed/graded accuracy will be tracked (by word/set) and made visible on the **All** screen.
